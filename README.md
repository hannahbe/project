project
=======

The project is a website for the Copy Color Jerusalem company, which is a small printing house.
The website will display a main page, a catalog, a portfolio, and a page where the client can make his own design (with background, photos, texts).
The website will alow the workers to edit the pages, in particular the catalog and the portfolio.

The diary can be found here: https://trello.com/b/AyLIWAyp/diary-hannah-bellaiche

The theme I wrote - copycolor - is a child theme of twentyfourteen.
In the file "twentyfourteen" I didn't write any code, but I use some code of it. All the code I wrote is in copycolor.

You will find the template for the main page in index.php.
Obviously the header is in header.php and the footer in footer.php.
page-catalog.php is the template for the catalog page of the website, while page.php is a general template for all pages (for now, it just says "if you are catalog or one of its subpages then display page-catalog.php, if not display index.php").
In functions.php you will find the functions related to the customizer.

For now you can ignore copycolor-customizer.js as I didn't finish it and for now I don't use it.
