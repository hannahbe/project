project
=======

The project is a website for the Copy Color Jerusalem company, which is a small printing house.
The website will display a main page, a catalog, a portfolio, and a page where the client can make his own design (with background, photos, texts).
The website will alow the workers to edit the pages, in particular the catalog and the portfolio.
